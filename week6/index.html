                <span>Milo is a sweet little kitten loking for his forever home! He is is 2 months old and is very playful and loves to cuddle up next you at night. Milo is litter-trained and is now eating hard food. Milo was rescued from underneath a ttuck when he was just 3 days old and we have nurtured and taken care of him ever since. We have given him all the love and nurturing a kitten could get with the time we had, but now,  it is time for him to be with a family who can give him that for eternity. Milo is available up for adoption and has had all his shots and will come with his flea medication.  </span>
